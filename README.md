This repository contains the Markdown page content and Webpack+React static site generator code for https://sdg-tracker.org/

Pushes to the master branch of this repository are automatically deployed to the live site via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The charts and data aren't stored here, only the links which specify embeds from the [owid-grapher](https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher) system.
